XRepository
===========

XRepository is built with a code-first, convention-over-configuration approach. You can configure as much or as little
as you like, but "out of the box", you should be able to have your project's data layer up and running extremely
quickly with very few lines of code.

*More documentation will come shortly, once I've placed all of the existing code into this GitHub repository and made
some changes to the way the existing code base works.*
